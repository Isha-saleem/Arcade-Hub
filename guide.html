                <p>
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty square,
                    aiming to be the first to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If all squares are
                    filled without a winner, the game is a draw. You can choose to play with AI (Bot) or a Player.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Hangman is a word guessing game. One player (the "computer") chooses a word or phrase, and the other player(You)
                    try to guess it by suggesting letters. The computer draws dashes representing the letters of the word. For each 
                    incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (the "hangman") is drawn. The game ends when the word is guessed 
                    correctly or the hangman is completed.

                <p>
                    Ping Pong, also known as table tennis, involves hitting a lightweight ball back and forth over a net on a table.
                    The goal is to make it difficult for your opponent to return the ball, with points scored when they fail to do so
                    legally. Players use paddles to strike the ball (here thin wood is used), aiming to land it on the opponent's side
                    of the table after it bounces once. The first one to score 5-points win. In this game, you can play with either a 
                    human or AI bot.

                <p>
                    The goal of 2048 is to combine tiles with the same number by sliding them on a 4x4 grid until you create a tile
                    with the number 2048. You win when you achieve the 2048 tile. The game ends when the board is full and no more 
                    moves are possible.

                <p>
                    The snake game involves guiding a snake-like entity around a board, eating food to grow longer, and avoiding collisions
                    with the walls or itself. The primary goal is to achieve the longest possible snake length before the game ends due to a
                    collision. Use Arrow Keys UP, DOwn, LEFT, RIGHT to move the snake.

                <p>
                    A Word Search game (also known as Word Seek, Word Find, or Word Sleuth) is a classic puzzle where the objective is
                    to find hidden words within a grid of seemingly random letters. The words can be arranged horizontally, vertically,
                    diagonally, and sometimes even backward.

                <p>
                     A "Sound Memory Game" is a variation of the classic memory game (also known as Concentration or Pairs), where
                    instead of matching visual images, players match sounds. It's a fantastic way to develop auditory memory, listening
                    skills, and concentration. The player should copy the sequence of the sound played.

                <p>
                    A "Math Memory Game" is a fantastic way to combine the fun of a classic memory (or Concentration) game with the 
                    educational benefits of practicing math skills. Instead of matching identical images or sounds, players match 
                    mathematical problems with their correct answers, or two problems that have the same answer. The player has to match 
                    the hidden cards by tapping them.

                <p>
                    In Dots and Boxes, players take turns drawing single horizontal or vertical lines between two adjacent dots on a 
                    grid. The goal is to complete the fourth side of as many 1x1 squares (boxes) as possible. If a player draws a line
                    that completes a box, they mark their initial inside it and get to take another turn immediately. The game continues
                    until all lines are drawn and all boxes are claimed. The player with the most captured boxes (score) at the end wins.

                <p>
                    udoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle played on a 9x9 grid, which is further divided into nine 3x3 smaller
                    grids (often called "boxes" or "blocks"). The objective is to fill every empty cell with a digit from 1 to 9, 
                    ensuring that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 boxes contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly
                    once, with no repeats. Puzzles begin with some cells already filled in as clues, and players use deductive reasoning 
                    and elimination to determine the correct placement of the remaining numbers, never guessing.
